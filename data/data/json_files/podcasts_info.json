Is it even possible to discuss truth in a safe way in a polarized United States? It is hard to imagine a safe conversation with your friends, co-workers, and family discussing the nation\u2019s biggest issues. What it would be like to listen to and watch political discussions without the current reactivity, meltdown, or withdrawal?  By listening in on the Purchasing Truth podcast with host Bill Stierle and moderator Tom, you will experience a discussion on why the restoration of the conversation about truth with perspective leads to a productive conversation in a partisan nation.  This podcast will address the use of language by our leaders and in the news that has been dividing us, distracting us, splitting us, and keeping us from the unity we desire. An image of Norman Rockwell\u2019s Thanksgiving in a distant American past reflects an American ideal captured in the little girl\u2019s face as she experiences family members leaning in for connection that welcomes and accepts diverse opinions. At that time, people held vibrant conversations that reinforced unity without the discourse breaking the family apart.   Today, America is very different. Freedom of speech and the technology age has brought a diversity of expression and access to instant information. Regrettably, it has also allowed for the expansion and amplification of marginal versions of truth and unverified opinions. With so many voices pulling for our attention, how can we accurately assess the reality or danger of all the things we hear?   This results in issues being used to create enemy images of each other and keep us in a state of disconnection that generates fear and anger. Each side is looking for a mistake or angle to exploit and sow dissent. Political truth is lost as identity politics and limited beliefs about party objectives are marginalized. Having safe conversations about our versions of truth has been lost. Truth is not absolute. It changes and evolves when we search for and learn new things. The good news is we can have a better, safer discussion about what\u2019s leaning towards false, partial-truth, or a full version of the truth and develop the ability to separate them from each other. In a world where the media is controlling the narrative, it\u2019s more important than ever to dissect the messages that are shoved in our faces on a daily basis. Together, Bill and Tom sift through the information and data that is available, providing clarity and guidance, and return to a place where honesty and integrity mean something. Bill Stierle is a thought leader in the integration of emotional intelligence and brain research. With over 27 years of speaking, training and executive consulting expertise, Bill\u2019s content and contributions are being felt daily inside the world\u2019s top business schools, Fortune 500 companies, nonprofits, and government institutions. His extensive knowledge in communication and human development provides fresh insight on motivation, conflict reduction, professional productivity, organizational performance, and individual effectiveness. His thought-provoking, dynamic trainings provide content-rich, practical information that leaves a lasting impact on his audiences.       Join Bill and Tom as they lead you to explore and engage truth in a different way. Discover language strategies, concepts, and skills that will move you closer to the truth as they tackle politics, leadership, health care, business, and many other areas that affect us all. Don\u2019t just accept whatever information comes your way. Learn how to approach and process it from different angles and protect yourself against the truth being hijacked.

At the heart of this parenting model is the CALM Technique which helps parents accurately attune to children\u2019s affect and experience. These empathic interactions release reward chemicals in the brain that stimulate positive emotions and increase order and balance in the nervous system. Reward chemicals, including natural opiates, endorphins, and a powerful hormone called oxytocin, reduce and inhibit stress hormones and bathe the brain in positive emotions that ripple through every cell in the body. The benefits of empathy and compassion have a strong base in science that cannot be underestimated. Simply put, it is brain food, the emotional nutrition all of us need, perhaps our children most of all.Although many parenting techniques stress the importance of empathy, Connected Parenting will show you how to use it skillfully to repair frayed bonds, deescalate tantrums, contain and correct difficult behaviors and help your child to become more confident and emotionally resilient. We use a collaborative and supportive coaching model and provide inspirational, easy-to-understand techniques grounded in neuroscience and attachment. In the end, your child will be more compliant, more relaxed, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 happier.

I'm a new mama to a vivacious baby girl and this podcast is all about postpartum care for the few months following birth, the time period also known as the Fourth Trimester. My postpartum doula, Esther Gallagher, is my co-host. She\u2019s a mother, grandmother, perinatal educator, birth and postpartum care provider. I've benefitted hugely from her support. All parents can benefit from the wisdom and support that a postpartum Doula provides. Fourth trimester care is about the practical, emotional and social support parents and baby require, and importantly, helps set the tone for the lifelong journey of parenting. This podcast provides resources for new parents and examines the socio-cultural influences on parenting. When I first became pregnant, I had never heard of postpartum Doulas, let alone knew what they did. So much of the training and preparation that expecting parents do is focused on the birth and newborn care. Once baby is born, often the first interaction parents have with medical or child professionals, other than the first pediatrician visits, is the six-week checkup with the OB/GYN. What about caring for mama and family between the birth and the six week doctor visit? What are the strategies for taking care of the partner and the rest of the family while looking after your newborn? Our podcasts contain expert interviews with specialists from many fields to cover topics including postpartum doula practices, prenatal care, prenatal and postnatal yoga, parenting, breastfeeding, physical recovery from birth, nutrition, newborn care, midwifery, negotiating family visitation, and many more.First-hand experience is shared through lots of stories from both new and seasoned parents. Hear what other parents are asking and what they have done in their own lives. We reference other podcasts, internet resources and real-life experts who can help you on your own parenting journey.

My name is Richard Ostler (twitter:  @papaostler) and am a native of Salt Lake City.  I have degrees from the University of Utah and Brigham Young University (business).  I married my best friend and eternal companion Sheila Juergens of Houston, Texas in 1990 and we are the parents of six children and two grandchildren and live near Cottonwood High School in Salt Lake City.   I believe in and am deeply committed to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and want it to work for a wider group.The name \u2018Papa Ostler\u2019 resulting from being introduced to Twitter by my High School age son Matt in 2010. I wanted the high school age youth to know I wasn\u2019t their age as I interacted with them \u2026 hence the name Papa Ostler.I served as a YSA Bishop in the West Valley City/Magna area of Salt Lake (released in 2016) and met some of the finest people I will ever know. In addition to meeting with wonderful active members of my Ward, I reached out and connected via social media (mostly via the private messaging features of FB and Twitter) with many of our inactive members and their non-member friends. Over time, many felt comfortable meeting with me and sharing their stories. Through hundreds of interviews and \u2018listening to understand\u2019, I was able to \u2018see\u2019 the church from the eyes of those on the outside.  Many feel the church is their \u2018spiritual home\u2019 but feel uncomfortable attending for a variety of reasons such as work-in-progress testimonies, concerns about church history, feeling unworthy because of past or current sin, don't fit the cultural mold, role of women, are LGBTQ and/or feel God's LGBTQ childen should be more welcomed in our congregations, etc.This podcast is designed to 'Have a Conversation' about some of the more complicated issues in our church to help all of us 'listen, learn and love' so we can minister in a more effective way to all of Heavenly Father\u2019s children.   Most podcasts will be from our LDS LGBTQ friends to give them voice so we can better understand their road, touch their cross, learn from them, and minister to them as directed by President M. Russell Ballard when he said 'Mormon leaders, along with the rank and file, need to listen to and understand what LGBT members are feeling and experiencing (Nov 2017 BYU Devotional).'   Some podcasts will be from LGBTQ allies sharing their experiences and how to be helpful.  Other podcasts will be from guests talking about other complicated topics such as mental health, returning from a mission early, overcoming sin, and faith challenges.Thank you for joining us.

For the first time polygamy is dissected through a feminist viewpoint, with attention given to the experiences of the women, women who sacrificed everything and suffered long and are never mentioned in museums or landmark tours. Their experiences, along with interviews with experts, sc20140302_130747holars, historians, and those still affected directly by the practice, paint a new portrait of how the west was shaped, by the hard work and toil of these invisible women, hidden away through controversy. Through Hansen\u2019s careful work, we see how the practice of polygamy affected every aspect of the LDS church\u2019s formation and is still a shadow hanging over the church, visible in it\u2019s approach to marriage, the role of women, and the temple ceremonies. Instead of the historical footnote polygamy is often treated as, Hansen shows how this practice, started in secret and a direct cause of Joseph Smith\u2019s death, responsible for driving the saints to Utah, and then outward again to Mexico and Canada, the root of power struggles both in the church and out, the cause of suspicion and eventually violence including the Mountain Meadows Massacre, was an instigator to most of the history of American West.
